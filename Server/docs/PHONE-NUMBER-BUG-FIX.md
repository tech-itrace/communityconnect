# Phone Number Validation Bug Fix

## Issue Summary
WhatsApp webhook was returning "Sorry, this service is only available to community members" error for valid members.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Request Flow
1. **Incoming Request**: `From=whatsapp:+919943549835`
2. **Old Code (Line 28 in whatsapp.ts)**:
   ```typescript
   const phoneNumber = From?.replace('whatsapp:+91', '').replace('whatsapp:+', '');
   ```
   - Result: `'9943549835'` (country code removed)

3. **Database Storage**: Phone numbers stored as `'919943549835'` (with country code)

4. **Validation Query**: Looking for `'9943549835'` in database
   - No match found because database has `'919943549835'`
   - Result: Member validation fails ❌

### The Problem
The code was **stripping the country code (91)** from the phone number, but the database stores phone numbers **with the country code**. This caused a mismatch during validation.

## Fix Applied

### Changed Code (Line 28 in whatsapp.ts)
```typescript
// Extract phone number (format: whatsapp:+919876543210)
// Remove 'whatsapp:+' prefix but keep the country code (91)
const phoneNumber = From?.replace('whatsapp:+', '');
```

### Result
- Input: `'whatsapp:+919943549835'`
- Extracted: `'919943549835'` ✓
- Database: `'919943549835'` ✓
- Match: **Success!** ✓

## Testing Verification

### Test Case
**Request Parameters**:
```
From=whatsapp:+919943549835
Body=Find web developers
ProfileName=Udhay
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. Extract phone: `'919943549835'`
2. Validate against DB: Should find "Mr., Udhayakumar, Ulaganathan"
3. Process search query successfully

## Files Modified
- `/Server/src/routes/whatsapp.ts` (Line 27-29)

## Deployment Notes
- No database migration needed
- No environment variable changes
- Simple code change - safe to deploy immediately
- Backward compatible with existing data
