## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Twilio Sandbox Only**
   - Limited to 72-hour sessions
   - Users must "join" first
   - Template restrictions
   - **Solution:** Apply for WhatsApp Business API

2. **No Outbound Messaging**
   - Bot only responds to incoming messages
   - Can't send proactive notifications
   - **Solution:** Add Twilio SDK for outbound messages

3. **Basic Session Management**
   - 30-minute TTL (could be longer)
   - No cross-device sync
   - **Enhancement:** Extend TTL, add device tracking

### Non-Issues (By Design)
- Phone number format handling: ✅ Robust normalization
- Member validation: ✅ Proper database lookup
- Rate limiting: ✅ Effective and user-friendly
