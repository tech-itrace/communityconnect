## Cost Comparison: DeepInfra vs Alternatives

### LLM Provider Comparison

For 1,000 queries/month (500 input + 300 output tokens average):

| Provider | Model | Monthly Cost | Savings vs Winner |
|----------|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **DeepInfra** | **Llama 3.1 8B** | **$0.05** | **✅ WINNER** |
| Google | Gemini Flash 1.5 | $0.13 | 2.6x more expensive |
| Groq | Mixtral 8x7B | $0.19 | 3.8x more expensive |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o-mini | $0.26 | 5.2x more expensive |
| DeepInfra | Llama 3.1 70B | $0.30 | 6x more expensive |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.51 | 10.2x more expensive |
| OpenAI | GPT-3.5-turbo | $0.70 | 14x more expensive |

**Key Insights:**
- DeepInfra Llama 3.1 8B is **14x cheaper** than OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **2.6x cheaper** than Google Gemini Flash
- Maintains very fast inference speed comparable to Groq
- 128K context window sufficient for conversation history
- Open-source model eliminates vendor lock-in

### Database Provider Comparison

#### MongoDB Atlas
```
Free Tier:     512MB storage, shared CPU (NO vector search ❌)
$9/month:      2GB RAM, 10GB storage, Vector Search included
$25/month:     4GB RAM, 20GB storage
```

**Issues:**
- Vector search not available in free tier
- No built-in authentication
- Horizontal scaling overkill for MVP

#### Supabase (PostgreSQL)
```
Free Tier:     500MB DB, 2GB bandwidth, Auth, pgvector, RLS ✅
$25/month:     8GB DB, 50GB bandwidth, daily backups
$100/month:    64GB DB, 250GB bandwidth
```

**Advantages:**
- All features included in free tier
- 2-minute setup vs 15-30 minutes
- Built-in authentication (saves 6+ hours)
- Real-time subscriptions for dashboards
- Easy migration path to self-hosted

#### Self-hosted Postgres
```
Railway:       $5 credit/month (500MB free)
Render:        $7/month (256MB RAM)
DigitalOcean:  $12/month (1GB RAM, 25GB SSD)
AWS RDS:       $15+/month (t3.micro)
```

**Considerations:**
- Higher initial setup time
- Manual authentication implementation
- Manual backup configuration
- Server maintenance overhead
- Cost increases immediately
