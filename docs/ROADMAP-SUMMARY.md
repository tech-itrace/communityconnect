**You have a solid foundation!** The core search and NL understanding works great. To make it production-ready:

**MUST DO (4 weeks):**
- ✅ Security: OTP + Rate Limiting
- ✅ WhatsApp: User interface
- ✅ Deploy: Railway + monitoring
- ✅ Dashboard: Basic management

**SHOULD DO (4 more weeks):**
- ✅ Multi-tenancy: Serve multiple communities
- ✅ Payments: Monetization
- ✅ Polish: Testing + docs

**Investment:** $15K-30K development + $20-100/month ops  
**Timeline:** 2-3 months to launch  
**Break-even:** 10 paying communities (~3-6 months)

**Recommendation:** Start with MVP+ (4 weeks, 1 community) → test with real users → iterate → scale to multi-tenant SaaS.

The hard part (AI/search) is done. Now it's about packaging it properly for users! 🚀
