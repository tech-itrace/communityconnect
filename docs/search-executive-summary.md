## 📌 Overview

Transform your business community CSV data into an intelligent, conversational search chatbot that helps members discover and connect with each other through natural language queries.

       1. Udhayakumar Ulaganathan
          📍 Chennai | 📞 +91 99435 49835
          🏢 Thoughtworks Technologies
          💼 Lead Consultant - Software Architect
       
       Would you like their email addresses?"
```
