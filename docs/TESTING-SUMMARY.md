## 📊 System Overview

```
You (WhatsApp) → Twilio Cloud → ngrok Tunnel → Local Server (MacBook)
                                                       ↓
                                           Supabase + DeepInfra
```

**Development:** Use ngrok (temporary URLs)
**Production:** Use Docker server (permanent URL)

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Install ngrok | 2 min |
| Start services | 2 min |
| Create Twilio account | 5 min |
| Join WhatsApp sandbox | 1 min |
| Configure webhook | 2 min |
| Add test user | 2 min |
| First test | 1 min |
| **Total** | **15 min** |

## 💰 Costs

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| ngrok (free tier) | $0 |
| Twilio sandbox | $0 |
| Testing (unlimited) | $0 |
| **Total** | **$0** |

## 🎯 What Works Now

✅ Your WhatsApp route is implemented
✅ Server can process messages
✅ Database is connected
✅ DeepInfra API is configured
✅ Semantic search works
✅ Conversation history tracking

**What's Missing:**
- Public URL (ngrok provides this)
- Twilio account (15 min to create)
- Phone number in database (1 SQL insert)

## 📝 Key Commands

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
cd /Users/udhay/Documents/Candorbees/communityConnect/Server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Test without WhatsApp
npm run test:whatsapp
```

## 🔗 Important URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| ngrok Web UI | http://localhost:4040 |
| ngrok Signup | https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup |
| Twilio Signup | https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio |
| Twilio Console | https://console.twilio.com |
| Twilio Debugger | https://twil.io/console/debugger |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About ngrok Free Tier
- ✅ Perfect for testing
- ⚠️ URL changes on restart
- 📌 Must update Twilio webhook each restart
- 💡 Keep ngrok running during testing

### About Twilio Sandbox
- ✅ Free and instant
- ⚠️ Only works with numbers that "join"
- ⚠️ Join code expires in 3 days (rejoin if needed)
- 💡 For production, apply for WhatsApp Business API

### About Phone Numbers
- Database format: `9876543210` (10 digits)
- WhatsApp sends: `whatsapp:+919876543210`
- Code handles conversion automatically

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
